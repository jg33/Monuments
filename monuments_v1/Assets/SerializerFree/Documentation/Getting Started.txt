It is so easy and fast to get started with Serializer Free, see below for fast initialization:

1 - Import the plugins folder to your plugins folder. (Optional)
2 - Then where your need to serialize anything include "using SerializerFree.Serializers;" and then
    when you need to serialize any thing do this "Serializer.Serialize (myObj, new BinarySerializer ());".

As you can see the initialization is so fast, because it has no serialization.

See example for more information. (SerializerFree/Example)
